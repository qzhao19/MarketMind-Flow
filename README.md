## 4. Installation and Usage

### 4.1 Install Dependencies
First, you need to install the required Python packages. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4.2 Install Redis and SQLite
1. Redis Installation (Required for task queue):
 - On macOS (using Homebrew):
    ```bash
    brew install redis
    brew services start redis
    ```
 - On Linux (using APT):
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install redis-server
    sudo systemctl start redis
    ```
 - On Windows:
    ```bash
    Download and install manually at https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases.
    After the installation, start the Redis serverï¼š
    redis-server
    ```
2. SQLite Installation (Required for database):
- SQLite is pre-installed on most systems. To verify:
    ```bash
    sqlite3 --version
    ```
- If not installed, follow the official guide: [SQLite Installation](https://sqlite.org/download.html)

### 4.3 Install Apifox (or Postman)
Download and install Apifox from [Apifox Official Website](https://apifox.com/)

### 4.4 Configure the Project
You may need to set up environment variables and modify the configuration files in the config directory according to your needs. For example, you can set the following configurations in ``settings.py``:

1. **Ollama Model Configuration**:
   - `LLM_BASE_URL`: The base URL for Ollama API (default: `http://localhost:11434`)
   - `LLM_MODEL`: The model name to use (default: `qwen2.5:0.5b`)
   - `LLM_API_KEY`: The API key for Ollama (default: `ollama`)

2. **Google Search Configuration**:
   - `SERPER_API_KEY`: Your Google Search API key (required for market analysis)
    ```bash
        os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"
    ```

3. **Database Configuration**:
   - `DATABASE_PATH`: Path to SQLite database file (default: `market-flow.db`)


### 4.5 Run the Project
To run the project, you can use the following command:
1. Start the Celery Worker:
    ```bash
    celery -A src.services.celery.celery_app:app worker \
            --loglevel=info -Q market_flow \
            --without-heartbeat \
            --without-mingle
    ```

2. Start the FastAPI Application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8012
    ```

3. Test with Apifox:

- Create a new POST API in Apifox:
    - Click "New Request" in Apifox
    - Set the request method to POST
    - Enter the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8012/api/marketflow`
    - In the "Body" tab, select "JSON" format
    - Add the following JSON structure:
    ```json
    {
        "customer_domain": "xxx",
        "project_description": "xxx"
    }
    ```
    - Click "Save" to store the API configuration

- Create a new GET API in Apifox:
    - Click "New Request" in Apifox
    - Set the request method to GET
    - Enter the URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8012/api/marketflow/{job_id}`
    - Click "Save" to store the API configuration

- Send the POST request to create a job, and then send the GET request to query the job status.
